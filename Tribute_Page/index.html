        <p id="tribute-info">Edward Carter was an African American soldier who died in 1963, but received the Medal of Honor in 1997 (34 years later).
            This was only after an investigation into why no African American soldiers received the Medal of Holor in WWII.
            At 28 years old he killed 6 and captured 2 german soldies and interrogated them even though he was wounded 5 times in the process.
            His actions saved others and he has received 7 other awards besides the Medal of Honor.
